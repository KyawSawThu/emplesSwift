#  MVP Example

##### Presentation Logic
* `View` - delegates user interaction events to the `Presenter` and displays data passed by the `Presenter`
* All `UIViewController`, `UIView`, `UITableViewCell` subclasses belong to the `View` layer
* Usually the view is passive / dumb - it shouldn't contain any complex logic
* `Presenter` - contains the presentation logic and tells the `View` what to present
* Usually we have one `Presenter` per scene (view controller)
* It doesn't reference the concrete type of the `View`, but rather it references the `View` protocol that is implemented usually by a `UIViewController/UIView` subclass
* It should be a plain `Swift` class and not reference any `iOS` framework classes - this makes it easier to reuse
* it uses `Model` to fetch data source, manupulate it using `DecoratorModelProtocol` and set it to view
* `Assembly` - injects the dependency object graph into the scene (view controller)
* You could very easily use a DI (dependency injection) library. [DIP](https://github.com/AliSoftware/Dip) is used here.
* `Router` - contains navigation / flow logic from one scene (view controller) to another
* In some communities / blog posts it might be referred to as a `FlowController`
* It is usually referenced only by the `Presenter`


##### Business Logic

* MPV does not describe business logic architecture. So it's up to developer how to implement it. Here is just a simple example.
* `Model` - it's either plain object that conatins source to display or interface to communicate with api (network/database)
* It is referenced by the `Presenter`.
* It communicates with network and sorage `API` to retrieve / persist the data
* Models objects used by your application such as `Order`, `Product`, `Shopping Cart`, etc
